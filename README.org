Many people place the power of org-mode into the reports provided by org-agenda, which filters and summarizes org entries by tags, todo states, priorities and tags. 

I don't do that. My mind is simple. I like trees. Trees are easy. You have one org mode file and you filter it for what you need, whether it's a quick glance at what you did last week or a peek at what you're currently working on. This package provides an interactive filter window to the native =org-match-sparse-tree= function, utilising the calendar window from =calendar.el= to help with defining the scope of the filtering query.

** Installation

   #+begin_src elisp
     (use-package org-treescope
       :custom (org-treescope-userbuffer "~/path/to/projects.org")
       :bind (("C-c M-t" . org-treescope)))       
   #+end_src

** Usage

   Once =org-treescope= is run, a minor mode is launched with the following controls which are designed to not interfere with =calendar-mode=. 

**** Time Range Shift

     | Binding      | Action                                              |
     |--------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
     | =left/right=   | Shift current range one day backward / forward      |
     | =up/down=      | Shift current range one week backward / forward     |
     | =C-left/right= | Move lowerbound of range one day backward / forward |
     | =M-left/right= | Move upperbound of range one day backward / forward |

**** Time Range Flank

     | Binding        | Action                                  |
     |----------------+-----------------------------------------|
     | =C-M-left/right= | Show all dates before/after centre date |
     | =C-M-down=       | Reset to range in previous section      |

**** Cycling States

     | Binding   | Action                                                          |
     |-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
     | =C-up/down= | Cycle through user-defined groups of =TODO= states                |
     | =M-up/down= | Cycle through user-defined groups of =PRIORITY= ranges            |
     | =t=         | Cycle through time modes =TIMESTAMP=, =SCHEDULED=, =DEADLINE=, =CLOSED= |

**** Other

     | Binding | Action                                          |
     |---------+-------------------------------------------------|
     | =f=       | Toggle automatic application of query on buffer |
     | =return=  | Apply current query to buffer                   |

     If your org file is large, there can be some slowdown when making incremental changes to states. Toggling this allows you to set the query string first before applying it with =return=.


** Customisation

   The user should set the =org-treescope-userbuffer= to a single org-mode file, and also check that the below scope types are set to reasonable ranges for that file.

**** Scope Types

     Currently supported types are =TODO= groups, =PRIORITY= ranges, and =TIMESTAMP= types. Currently these are set to:

     | Customisable Variables and Settings | Current Setting                       | Info                              |
     |-------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+-----------------------------------|
     | =org-treescope-todogroups=            | =DONE=, =TODO= =DOING=, =TODO= =DONE= =WAITING=   | Any number of elements in a group |
     | =org-treescope-prioritygroups=        | =A=, =A= =C=, =D=                             | Any number of elements in a group |
     | =org-treescope-timegroups=            | =TIMESTAMP=, =SCHEDULED=, =DEADLINE= =CLOSED= | Only one of the four mentioned    |

     These can be customised to specify different groups/pairs that might be more useful to the user.

**** Faces

     The faces used within the calendar can also be customised, and the user should see the =defface= definitions used in the source.

     | Variable                    | Info                                                                                 |
     |-----------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
     | =org-treescope-marker-range=  | The face used to specify all dates within the range except the centre midpoint date. |
     | =org-treescope-marker-midday= | The face used only by the centre midpoint date.                                      |
