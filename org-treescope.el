;; Navigating through an org file to see what needs to be done
;; this week and what was completed last month can be tricky.
;; This tool provides a time window to analyse your org file.

(require 'cal-move)

(require 'org-treescope-query)
;; brings faces, cyclestates, calendarranges, datehelper, calendar
